## Installation

### Method 1: ComfyUI Manager (Recommended)
Search for "OmniVoice" in ComfyUI Manager and click Install.

### Method 2: Manual Install
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/saganaki22/ComfyUI-OmniVoice-TTS.git
cd ComfyUI-OmniVoice-TTS
python install.py
```

### Why `--no-deps`?
The `omnivoice` pip package specifies `torch==2.8.*` as a dependency, which can downgrade your PyTorch to a CPU-only version and break ComfyUI's GPU acceleration. We work around this by installing `omnivoice` with `--no-deps` in `install.py`, then separately installing only the missing dependencies that ComfyUI doesn't already provide.

### If PyTorch Gets Broken
If another package accidentally downgrades your PyTorch, restore it with:
```bash
# Check your CUDA version first:
python -c "import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)"

# Restore PyTorch (replace cu128 with your version):
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
```

- `bf16` — bfloat16 (requires Ampere+ GPU)
- `fp16` — float16
- `fp32` — float32 (highest precision, most VRAM)

**Auto-download:** Select "whisper-large-v3-turbo (auto-download)" to download on first use.
## Multi-Speaker Usage
Use `[Speaker_N]:` tags in text to assign lines to different speakers:
```
[Speaker_1]: Hello, I'm speaker one.
[Speaker_2]: And I'm speaker two!
[Speaker_1]: Nice to meet you!
```
Each speaker needs reference audio connected to the corresponding `speaker_N_audio` input.

Comma-separated attributes for `voice_instruct`:
| Category | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Gender** | `male`, `female` |
| **Age** | `child`, `young`, `middle-aged`, `elderly` |
| **Pitch** | `very low pitch`, `low pitch`, `medium pitch`, `high pitch`, `very high pitch` |

| **Chinese Dialect** | `四川话`, `陕西话`, `广东话`, etc. |

- `[laughter]` — Natural laughter
- `[sigh]` — Expressive sigh
- `[sniff]` — Sniffing sound
- `[question-en]`, `[question-ah]`, `[question-oh]`, `[question-ei]`, `[question-yi]` — Question intonations

|-----------|---------------|
| fp32 | ~8-12 GB |
| bf16/fp16 | ~4-6 GB |
| With CPU offload | ~2-4 GB |
## Troubleshooting
### Model download fails (China)
Set the HuggingFace mirror before starting ComfyUI:
```bash
export HF_ENDPOINT="https://hf-mirror.com"
```
### Whisper re-downloads every run
Connect `OmniVoice Whisper Loader` to `whisper_model` input on Voice Clone TTS to cache the model:
### CUDA out of memory
- Set `keep_model_loaded = False`
- Use `dtype = fp16` or `bf16`
- Use `device = cpu` (slower but works)
### Import errors after install
Restart ComfyUI completely to reload Python modules.
